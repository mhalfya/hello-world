# hello-world

Hi everyone!

I'm currently a fourth year Economics major and I am very interested in learning Python! I'm very new to coding however, I am passionate about Fintech and financial modelling. My goal is to become experienced enough with Python, and potentially R, to create my own Fintech/financial modelling applications and/or algorithms.

I'm open to any suggestions or advice!
